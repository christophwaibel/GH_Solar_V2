# GH_Solar_V2
Solar irradiation model plug-in for Rhinoceros Grasshopper. Version 2.

To Do:
- [x] Perez diffuse sky model
- [x] skydome with equal patches
- [x] snow cover
- [x] trees
- [x] annual interpolation trees
- [x] specular inter-reflections max 2 bounces
- [x] annual interpolation specular inter-reflections
- [ ] specular inter-reflections refraction coefficients
- [x] diffuse inter-reflections max 1 bounce
- [x] annual interpolation diffuse inter-reflections
- [ ] multi-threading
- [ ] precise calculation of equinox & solstice dates (SunVector.cs, int [] GetEquinoxSolstice(...))


Bugs:
- [ ] values underestimated for geometries close to origin (0,0,0)
